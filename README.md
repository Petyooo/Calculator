# Calculator
This is a simple Calculator application written in Java. The original base code is from https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse501/labs/Lab1/Lab1.htm

The original Calculator app was limited because it could not parse expressions and, for example, had no functionality for parentheses. 
I modified the app to use a mathematical expression parser (exp4j) so that the user could enter a full expression for evaluation. 

The Master branch contains the original Calculator version. The "MyVersion1" branch contains the expanded version.

A future goal is to learn how to code the math expression parser.
